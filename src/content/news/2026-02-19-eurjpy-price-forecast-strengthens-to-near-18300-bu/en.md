EUR/JPY has gained momentum and is trading near 183.00, maintaining a bullish tone as it attracts buyers around 182.90 during the early European session on Thursday. The pair's upward movement signals continued strength in the euro against the yen, with market sentiment favoring further gains.

The bullish outlook remains intact as long as EUR/JPY stays above the 182.90 support level. A break above 183.00 could pave the way for a test of higher levels, potentially driving the pair towards 183.50 or beyond. Traders will closely monitor key economic data and developments for further clues on the pair's direction.
