EUR/GBP is trading at 0.8680 on Monday, up by 0.10% for the day. The pair is seeing slight support from the Euro, despite weak German sentiment figures failing to spark significant movement in the foreign exchange market. Economic data from Germany has yet to provide any substantial momentum, keeping the market relatively stable.

Meanwhile, the UK’s economic outlook remains steady, helping to cushion the pair from larger fluctuations. With the Euro showing only modest strength and UK fundamentals holding firm, EUR/GBP is likely to continue trading in a narrow range unless more substantial news emerges from either region.
