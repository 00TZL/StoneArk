EUR/USD is sliding toward 1.1850 amid rising safe-haven demand, following an opening gap up. The pair is currently trading around 1.1860 during the Asian session on Monday, showing signs of weakness as risk sentiment takes a hit. This decline comes as investors seek refuge in safer assets, pushing the euro lower against the U.S. dollar.

Market participants are keeping a close eye on Germany’s IFO Business Sentiment Index, set to be released later today. The data could offer crucial insights into the health of Europe’s largest economy and potentially influence further movement in EUR/USD, depending on whether the figures meet or miss expectations.
