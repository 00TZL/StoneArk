The Japanese Yen weakened against the US Dollar as concerns over Japan’s fiscal challenges outweighed expectations of a potential Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike. This dynamic led to a fresh wave of buying in the USD/JPY pair, which surged past the mid-153.00s during the Asian trading session on Wednesday. Despite BoJ’s possible tightening measures, investor sentiment was dampened by fiscal uncertainty in Japan.

Following the volatile price action seen on Tuesday, the USD/JPY pair continued to draw buyers, driven by the US Dollar’s strength. Market participants are also awaiting the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes later in the week, which could provide further clarity on the US central bank's monetary policy outlook.
