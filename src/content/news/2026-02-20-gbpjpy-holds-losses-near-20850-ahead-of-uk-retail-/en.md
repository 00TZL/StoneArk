GBP/JPY extends its losses for the second consecutive session, hovering near the 208.60 level during Friday's Asian trading hours. The pair has been under pressure as market participants await key economic data from the UK, with Retail Sales and PMI reports set to be released later today. These data points could provide further insight into the health of the UK economy, influencing investor sentiment and the currency pair's direction.

The ongoing weakness in GBP/JPY comes ahead of these crucial data releases, with the pair currently holding losses near 208.50. Traders are closely monitoring the figures, as a stronger-than-expected outcome could potentially lend support to the British pound, while disappointing results may weigh further on the currency.
