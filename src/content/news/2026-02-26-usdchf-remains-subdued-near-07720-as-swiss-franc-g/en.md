USD/CHF continues its downward trend, marking a fifth consecutive day of losses, and is currently trading near 0.7720 during the Asian session on Thursday. The pair has remained under pressure, with the US dollar struggling to gain momentum.

The Swiss Franc (CHF) is benefitting from increased safe-haven demand as global trade tensions resurface. Investors have turned to the Franc for stability amid concerns over potential market volatility, further weighing on the USD/CHF pair. As tensions persist, the Franc’s appeal as a safe asset is expected to continue influencing the pair’s movement in the near term.
