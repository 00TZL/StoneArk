Gold (XAU/USD) continues its remarkable ascent, marking its ninth consecutive day of gains as safe-haven demand remains strong. On Thursday, the precious metal surged more than 3%, reaching the $5,600 level during the Asian trading session. This ongoing rally reflects heightened investor sentiment amid global uncertainties, driving many to seek refuge in gold.

The sustained surge in gold prices highlights the metal's appeal as a protective asset amid market volatility. As geopolitical tensions, inflation fears, and economic concerns persist, traders are increasingly turning to gold, reinforcing its status as a reliable safe haven. With this latest uptick, many analysts are closely monitoring the market for potential further movements in the coming days.
