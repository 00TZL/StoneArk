The EUR/USD pair is under pressure as it struggles to maintain ground below the 1.1850 level, trading around 1.1840 in the early European session on Wednesday. The currency pair faces renewed demand for the US Dollar, which has prompted the downward movement.

Market participants are closely awaiting the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes later today, with traders hoping for insights into potential future rate cuts. Any indication of a shift in the Federal Reserve's stance could drive further volatility in the EUR/USD pair as investors position themselves for the next phase of monetary policy.
