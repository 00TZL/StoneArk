GBP/USD surged over 0.31% during the North American session on Friday, climbing above the 1.3540 level. The pair's rally was fueled by stronger-than-expected UK Retail Sales and PMI data, which exceeded market expectations and provided a boost to the British pound.

Despite the US Dollar (USD) trimming its losses after a positive Consumer Sentiment report, the GBP/USD remained buoyed. The upbeat data from the UK highlighted economic resilience, helping the pound strengthen against the greenback. This move comes amid ongoing concerns about the global economic outlook and the relative performance of the UK economy.
