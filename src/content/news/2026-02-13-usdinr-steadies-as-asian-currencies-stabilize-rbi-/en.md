USD/INR steadied on Friday, recovering from modest losses in the previous session. The pair is expected to trade within the 90.50–91.00 range, as market sentiment remains cautious amidst ongoing risk-off conditions. Investors are closely watching for signs of volatility in the global markets, which have contributed to a measured pace of trading in the currency pair.

Asian currencies have shown signs of stabilization, which is offering some support to the Indian Rupee. However, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervention remains a key factor to watch, as any action from the central bank could influence the direction of the pair in the coming sessions.
