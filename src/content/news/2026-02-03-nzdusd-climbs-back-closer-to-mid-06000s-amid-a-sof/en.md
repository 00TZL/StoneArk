The NZD/USD pair is showing resilience just below the 0.6000 mark, gaining significant momentum during the Asian session on Tuesday. This upward movement comes as the US dollar softens, driven by ongoing concerns over the Federal Reserve’s policy outlook. Despite the pair's recent struggles to maintain levels above 0.6000, it has managed to hold steady, signaling a potential for further gains.

The key driver behind the NZD/USD rally is the growing divergence between the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). While the Fed is expected to adopt a cautious stance, the RBNZ continues to maintain a more hawkish approach, further boosting the kiwi dollar's strength. As a result, the pair is climbing back towards the mid-0.6000s, suggesting a continued bullish bias.
