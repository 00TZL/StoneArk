USD/CHF has stabilized near 0.7650 after two consecutive days of losses, with the pair hovering around 0.7670 during the Asian trading session on Tuesday. The US Dollar's demand has softened recently, limiting the pair's movement and preventing further declines.  

Market sentiment remains cautious, as traders await further economic data and developments from the U.S. and global markets. The Swiss Franc continues to benefit from risk-off flows, but USD/CHF’s price action shows that the US Dollar is not under significant pressure at this point. The pair's outlook remains tied to upcoming economic releases and shifts in investor sentiment.
