AUD/JPY advanced beyond the mid-108.00s on Monday, extending gains as the Japanese Yen weakened in the wake of Japan's disappointing fourth-quarter GDP figures. The softer growth data dampened expectations that the Bank of Japan will move quickly with additional rate hikes, reducing support for the currency and allowing the cross to push higher.

With investors reassessing the policy outlook, speculation around near-term tightening has eased, pressuring Japanese yields and the broader Yen complex. The shift in sentiment provided room for the Australian Dollar to capitalize, even as broader risk appetite remained steady. As a result, AUD/JPY regained positive traction at the start of the new week, holding comfortably above the mid-108.00s threshold. Markets will now monitor upcoming Japanese data closely.
