The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to capitalize on a weaker US Dollar (USD), maintaining its bullish momentum following a strong weekly gap opening. During the Asian session on Monday, the Yen surged to its highest level since November 14, as traders remain cautious about potential intervention risks and the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish stance.

The Yen's gains are further supported by growing concerns over the BoJ's tightening measures, which have fueled speculation of more aggressive action. With the USD facing weakness across the board, JPY bulls have managed to retain control of the market, keeping upward pressure on the pair. This ongoing strength highlights persistent investor confidence in the Yen amid a broader USD downturn.
