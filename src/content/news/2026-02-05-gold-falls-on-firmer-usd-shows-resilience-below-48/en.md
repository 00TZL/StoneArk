Gold (XAU/USD) saw significant selling pressure following a failed attempt to break the $5,100 mark overnight, plunging below the $4,800 level during Thursday's Asian session. This sharp decline comes amid a stronger US dollar, which has weighed on precious metal prices.

Despite the downturn, gold has displayed resilience, holding steady just under the $4,800 level. The dovish stance of the Federal Reserve and ongoing geopolitical tensions continue to provide underlying support, preventing a more severe collapse. Investors remain cautious, eyeing potential volatility in both the dollar and broader market sentiment.
