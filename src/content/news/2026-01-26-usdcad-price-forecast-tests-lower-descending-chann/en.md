USD/CAD continues its downward trend, marking a sixth consecutive session of losses, with the pair hovering around 1.3680 during the Asian trading session on Monday. The currency pair has been on a steady decline, as it remains confined within a newly formed descending channel on the daily chart.

The technical outlook suggests a persistent bearish bias, with the next key support level seen near the lower boundary of the descending channel around 1.3650. A break below this level could reinforce the downward momentum, potentially pushing the pair toward further declines. Traders will be closely watching this level for any signs of further weakness or potential reversal.
