Gold prices soared during the North American session on Friday, reaching a new all-time high of $4,988. The surge came as the US Dollar (USD) plummeted due to rumors of intervention by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to boost the Japanese Yen (JPY). The weakening of the USD against major currencies, particularly the Yen, fueled investor optimism, pushing gold prices higher by over 1%.

The potential intervention sparked a shift in risk appetite, driving up demand for safe-haven assets like gold. The movement of the XAU/USD pair reflected the broader market dynamics, as traders adjusted their positions in response to speculation surrounding the BoJ's actions. With gold testing fresh highs, market participants are closely watching any developments that could influence the exchange rate between the USD and JPY in the coming sessions.
