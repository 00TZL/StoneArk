Gold (XAU/USD) has shown a strong rebound from the mid-$4,600s region, recovering from a four-day low hit during the Asian session on Friday. The precious metal found support around $4,655, aided by a weaker risk sentiment in global markets, which pushed investors toward safer assets. 

Despite the bounce, gold struggles to maintain upward momentum, as it faces resistance from broader market conditions.
