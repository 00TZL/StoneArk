The GBP/USD pair remains strong, hovering near a four-month high in the mid-1.3600s as the U.S. dollar weakens broadly. After reaching approximately 1.3680 during the Asian session, the pair has pulled back slightly, retreating a few pips but still maintaining an impressive position.

As the new week begins, the pair has filled a modest bullish gap, reflecting continued optimism for the British pound against the dollar. Market dynamics suggest that traders are closely watching economic indicators and geopolitical developments, which could further influence the pair's trajectory in the coming days.
