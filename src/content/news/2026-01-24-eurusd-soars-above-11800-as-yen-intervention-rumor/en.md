EUR/USD surged above the 1.1800 mark late in Friday's North American session, benefiting from a significant decline in the US Dollar. The move came after rumors circulated that Japan may intervene in the foreign exchange markets to strengthen the Yen, triggering a sharp sell-off in the USD. The US Dollar Index (DXY) lost over 0.70% as a result.

This sudden shift in sentiment saw the EUR/USD exchange rate rise, highlighting the volatility in forex trading. The potential intervention in the Japanese Yen led traders to reposition their portfolios, causing the Dollar to weaken across the board. The market will now be closely monitoring any official statements from Japan regarding the matter, as such moves could have lasting effects on USD and EUR market dynamics.
