The USD/CHF pair has recently slipped below the 0.7800 mark, prompting concerns in Zurich as the trade-weighted Swiss Franc nears new all-time highs. The continued strength of the franc is raising questions about its impact on the Swiss economy and could force the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to reconsider its monetary policy.

Analysts believe that if this trend persists, the SNB may need to reintroduce negative interest rates to counteract the franc's appreciation. Currently, resistance for USD/CHF is seen around the 0.7800/7810 range, which could limit further downside momentum in the near term.
