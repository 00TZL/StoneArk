Silver (XAG/USD) has surged to unprecedented heights, breaking above the $110 mark as macroeconomic uncertainties drive strong demand. Currently trading at approximately $109.50, the precious metal has experienced a remarkable daily gain of 6.90%. Investor sentiment is increasingly leaning toward safe-haven assets, with silver emerging as a top choice amid ongoing economic concerns.

This impressive rally reflects broader market trends, as traders seek refuge from volatility in other financial instruments. With inflation fears and geopolitical tensions persisting, demand for silver remains robust, suggesting that this upward trajectory may continue. As the week unfolds, market participants will be closely monitoring economic indicators that could further influence silver prices and overall market stability.
