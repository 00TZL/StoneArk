The NZD/USD pair is holding steady near the 0.6025 mark during the Asian session on Friday, consolidating after a pullback from a two-week high. Traders appear cautious ahead of the upcoming US CPI report, with the pair trading just below the 0.6050 level. 

The mixed market signals have led to a pause in the pair’s recent movement, as investors await further cues from the inflation data. The report, set for release later in the day, could significantly impact market sentiment and dictate the next move for the NZD/USD pair, which has found short-term support in the 0.6025 region.
