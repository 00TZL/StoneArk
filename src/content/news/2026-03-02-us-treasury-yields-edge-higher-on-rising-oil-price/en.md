US Treasury yields nudged higher in Monday’s Asian session, driven by rising oil prices and renewed inflation concerns. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield advanced 75 basis points to 3.98%, reflecting cautious investor sentiment as markets weigh potential pressure on the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish stance. The 30-year Treasury bond yield also climbed, reaching 4.657%, signaling longer-term borrowing costs are adjusting alongside expectations for sustained inflation.  

Shorter-dated debt followed the upward trend, with the 2-year Treasury note yield rising to 3.40%. Traders noted that elevated energy prices could feed into broader inflationary pressures, keeping bond markets on edge. Overall, Treasury yields continued to reflect a delicate balance between economic growth prospects and the Fed’s policy outlook.
