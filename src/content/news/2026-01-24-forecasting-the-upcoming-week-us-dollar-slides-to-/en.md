The US Dollar (USD) closed the week near a four-month low at 97.80, reflecting continued weakness in global markets. This decline came as risk aversion took hold, pushing traders away from the greenback. In particular, the EUR/USD pair saw upward momentum, with the euro gaining strength against the USD. This shift highlights growing market uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision.

As the market braces for the Fed's next move, the USD remains under pressure, with trading sentiment dominated by concerns over potential rate changes and global economic conditions. The weak performance of the dollar, alongside a cautious outlook for the Fed, could lead to further declines in the USD index. Traders are now eyeing key technical levels for guidance in the coming days.
