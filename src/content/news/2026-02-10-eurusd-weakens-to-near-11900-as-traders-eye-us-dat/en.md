The EUR/USD pair weakened to approximately 1.1905 during early European trading on Tuesday, reversing its two-day winning streak. The pair's decline comes as traders turn their attention to upcoming U.S. economic data, which could offer fresh insights into the Federal Reserve's policy outlook.

Market participants are particularly focused on U.S. reports that may influence the dollar's trajectory. As the pair retreats from recent highs, expectations surrounding the data are contributing to the cautious sentiment. With the euro struggling to maintain its momentum, the 1.1900 level now serves as a key psychological support point for EUR/USD traders.
