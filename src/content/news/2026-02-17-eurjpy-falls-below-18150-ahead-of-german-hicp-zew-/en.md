EUR/JPY drops below 181.50 during Tuesday's Asian session, trading near 181.40 after two consecutive days of gains. The euro is under pressure as the Japanese yen strengthens, fueled by growing speculation that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could raise interest rates sooner than expected.

The decline in EUR/JPY comes ahead of key economic releases from Germany, with the German HICP and ZEW Survey data set to be announced later in the day. These reports could offer further insight into the European economic outlook, potentially influencing the euro's movement against the yen as traders weigh the outlook for both central banks.
