The EUR/JPY saw a second consecutive day of declines on Monday, with the pair dipping to a five-week low of 181.91. The Japanese Yen has gained momentum as investors brace for the possibility of intervention from Japan's authorities. As concerns about the Yen's weakening persist, the market anticipates potential measures to stabilize the currency.

At the time of writing, EUR/JPY is trading at 182.25, testing support around the 182.00 level. The outlook remains uncertain as traders monitor developments surrounding potential intervention, which could trigger significant volatility in the coming days.
