Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiji Kihara said Monday that authorities stand ready to take “appropriate action” in the foreign exchange market, in line with the Japan-U.S. joint statement, keeping official attention firmly on yen moves and broader FX volatility. His remarks reinforce Japan’s message that it is monitoring market conditions closely and will respond if needed to curb excessive swings.

Kihara, however, stopped short of confirming market intervention steps and declined to comment on reports that officials had conducted so-called “rate checks,” a process used to gauge real-time currency levels with banks. The comments come as traders remain alert to any signals of policy action from Tokyo amid ongoing currency fluctuations.
