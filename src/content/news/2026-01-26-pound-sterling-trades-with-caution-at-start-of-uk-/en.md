The Pound Sterling (GBP) is trading cautiously at the start of a data-light week for the UK, edging lower against its major counterparts on Monday. While the currency faces some downward pressure, it remains relatively resilient compared to its North American peers. This muted movement comes as investors await further economic cues in the coming days, with little in the way of key data scheduled from the UK.

Against the backdrop of a quieter week for UK economic news, market sentiment has been subdued, leading to a cautious outlook for the GBP. Despite this, the currency is outperforming the Canadian Dollar and the US Dollar, which are seeing more pronounced losses in early trading. Traders are likely to stay on the sidelines until more substantial data emerges.
