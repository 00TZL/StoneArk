WTI crude oil continues to build on its recent momentum, trading near $61.10 early Monday in Europe. The price has gained for the second consecutive session, driven by growing supply concerns in key regions. 

The rise is primarily attributed to a slowdown in Russian fuel oil exports and ongoing disruptions in major U.S. production areas. These factors have tightened global oil supply, pushing prices higher. As a result, WTI remains supported above the $61 mark, with market attention focusing on further potential disruptions.
