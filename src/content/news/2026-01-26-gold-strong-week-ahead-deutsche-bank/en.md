Gold is set for a strong week ahead, according to Deutsche Bank’s Early Morning Reid Macro Strategy report. The precious metal has seen a notable surge of +8.52%, approaching the $5,000 mark. This sharp rally is attributed to growing geopolitical concerns, which have driven investors toward safe-haven assets like gold.

The report highlights that the current momentum in gold prices is largely driven by global uncertainties, reinforcing gold's role as a hedge against volatility. As geopolitical tensions persist, gold continues to attract strong demand, positioning itself for a potentially powerful week in the markets. Traders will be closely monitoring any developments that could further boost its upward trajectory.
