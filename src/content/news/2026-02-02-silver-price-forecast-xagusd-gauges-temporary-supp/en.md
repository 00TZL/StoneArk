Silver prices opened the week on a cautious note, with XAG/USD attempting to stabilize above the $70 psychological zone as markets head into the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) week. The white metal showed limited directional conviction, reflecting a wait-and-see approach among traders ahead of key US labor market data that could influence Federal Reserve policy expectations.

During the Asian trading session, Silver hovered near the $80 mark, modestly recovering from last Friday’s decline. The metal remains slightly above a fresh four-week low of $73.33, highlighting ongoing downside pressure despite the tentative bounce. Overall sentiment stays fragile, with near-term price action likely driven by upcoming macroeconomic releases and US dollar dynamics.
