EUR/USD surged 0.36% to near 1.1900 during the Asian trading session on Monday, reaching levels close to a four-year high at 1.1920. The pair's strength comes as the US Dollar (USD) continues to weaken, extending its losses from last week. The dollar's decline is driven by caution among traders ahead of the Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy decision scheduled for Wednesday.

The upcoming Fed announcement is creating uncertainty in the markets, with investors closely watching for any signs of future interest rate moves or changes in economic outlook. This hesitation has kept the USD under pressure, providing room for the Euro to make gains against the greenback. The EUR/USD could continue to see upward momentum if the Fed signals a dovish stance.
