EUR/USD is seeing modest declines on Monday, currently trading at 1.1855, after peaking at a fresh four-month high of 1.1875 earlier in the session. The pullback comes as German business sentiment data disappointed expectations, weighing on the euro.

The German Ifo Business Climate Index for January came in weaker than anticipated, signaling concerns over the country’s economic outlook. This unexpected data release has caused some pressure on the euro, tempering the earlier bullish momentum. Traders will now look ahead to further economic reports for additional clues on the euro's direction.
