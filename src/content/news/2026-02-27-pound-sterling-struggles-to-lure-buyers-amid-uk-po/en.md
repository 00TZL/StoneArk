The Pound Sterling faces challenges in attracting buyers amid ongoing political uncertainties in the UK and a dovish stance from the Bank of England (BoE). The GBP/USD pair struggles to sustain momentum following a modest rebound from the 1.3445 region, which marked the weekly low, and remains confined to a tight range during the Asian session on Friday.

Market participants continue to be cautious about the British currency as the political landscape and expectations of further BoE easing weigh on sentiment. Despite the bounce, the pair’s inability to break through resistance levels indicates a lack of conviction among traders, with broader risk sentiment likely to influence any potential moves in the coming sessions.
