Gold (XAU/USD) is maintaining its strength close to the record highs reached earlier in the Asian session on Monday, consolidating in a bullish pattern. The precious metal is supported by a global flight to safety, as investors seek stability amid ongoing economic uncertainties. With inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions weighing on markets, gold remains a preferred asset.

Additionally, the weakness of the U.S. dollar continues to bolster gold’s appeal. As the greenback struggles to gain traction, the outlook for XAU/USD remains positive, with the $5,100 target in sight. Investors are eyeing further gains, fueled by both the market’s risk aversion and the dollar's ongoing downturn.
