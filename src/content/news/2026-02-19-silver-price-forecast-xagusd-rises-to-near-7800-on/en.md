Silver (XAG/USD) continues to climb, reaching near $78.00 per troy ounce during Thursday's Asian trading session, marking its second consecutive day of gains. The precious metal is benefitting from strong safe-haven demand, which has been bolstered by ongoing geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran.

The risk-averse sentiment in global markets has pushed investors toward Silver, traditionally seen as a safe investment in times of uncertainty. As concerns over potential escalations in the US-Iran standoff grow, the increased demand for risk protection is expected to keep Silver prices elevated in the short term.
