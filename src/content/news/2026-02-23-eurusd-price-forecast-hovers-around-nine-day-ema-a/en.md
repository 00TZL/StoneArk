EUR/USD continues to push higher for the second consecutive session, trading near 1.1820 during the Asian trading hours on Monday. The pair remains supported above the key 1.1800 level, hovering around the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA), which reflects a neutral short-term trend.

The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 51, signaling a neutral market sentiment after crossing back above the midline. This suggests that momentum has stabilized, with neither bulls nor bears in control at the moment. Traders are likely to look for further developments to gauge the next directional move.
