EUR/JPY continues its downward movement for the second consecutive session, currently hovering around 184.70 during the Asian trading hours on Friday. The pair faces pressure as it approaches key support near the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA) around 184.50, suggesting further downside potential. 

On the daily chart, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55.67, remaining above the neutral 50 mark. This indicates a mild bullish bias despite the current bearish momentum, suggesting that EUR/JPY could see a potential rebound if it holds above the EMA support level. Traders will closely monitor this level for signs of either a breakout or reversal.
