EUR/JPY continues its sharp decline, extending the retracement from the 186.25 level for a fourth consecutive day. During the Asian session on Thursday, the pair dropped to its lowest point in over two months, reaching fresh support near 181.00. 

With the pair now testing key technical levels, a break below the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) is eagerly awaited. If EUR/JPY fails to hold above this level, further downside momentum could take the cross even lower, potentially targeting the 180.00 mark. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments for any signs of a sustained bearish trend.
