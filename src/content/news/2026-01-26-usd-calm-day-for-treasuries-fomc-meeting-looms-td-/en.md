The U.S. dollar saw a quiet session in the forex market as Treasury yields held steady. With minimal movement in Treasury rates, the market found support, reflecting a stable environment ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Traders are anticipating the Fed to maintain its current policy stance, keeping interest rates unchanged.

Looking ahead, attention is firmly on the FOMC meeting, where the Fed is expected to stay on hold amidst ongoing economic data assessments. With no major shifts expected, the U.S. dollar remains relatively calm, but any surprises from the Fed’s commentary could still influence market sentiment in the coming days.
