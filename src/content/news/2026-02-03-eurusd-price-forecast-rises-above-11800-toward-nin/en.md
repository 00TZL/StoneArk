EUR/USD has bounced back following two consecutive days of losses, trading at approximately 1.1810 during the Asian session on Tuesday. The pair's recovery suggests some short-term bullish momentum, though the technical outlook remains cautious. The price is still hovering just below the ascending channel pattern on the daily chart, indicating the possibility of a bearish reversal if the upward momentum falters.

Looking ahead, the next key resistance lies near the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA), which could act as a barrier to further gains. A sustained break above this level could signal more upside potential for the pair, while a failure to clear it might reinforce the bearish bias. Traders will closely monitor price action for confirmation of the next directional move.
