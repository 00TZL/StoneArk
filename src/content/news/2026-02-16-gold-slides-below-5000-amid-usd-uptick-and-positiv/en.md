Gold (XAU/USD) has slipped below the $5,000 mark as the US dollar strengthens and risk sentiment remains positive. The precious metal faces renewed selling pressure at the start of the week, pulling back from Friday's sharp rally, which saw a gain of more than $150 from levels just under $4,900.

The upside momentum has stalled as market optimism boosts riskier assets, leaving gold vulnerable to further declines. However, with support likely around the recent low of $4,900, the downside appears limited for now. Investors are keeping a close watch on any shifts in market sentiment, with further gains in the USD potentially putting additional pressure on gold prices.
