**GBP/USD Price Forecast: Rebounding Towards 1.3850 Near Four-Year Highs**

The GBP/USD pair has bounced back from its recent declines, currently hovering around 1.3830 during the Asian trading session on Thursday. This recovery brings the currency pair closer to the crucial 1.3850 level, which is near its four-year highs. 

However, technical analysis suggests a potential bearish reversal is on the horizon. As the daily chart reveals a narrowing range within a rising wedge pattern, this indicates a diminishing buyer momentum, which could signal caution for traders looking to capitalize on further gains. The market will be closely watching for any signs of a trend reversal in the coming sessions.
