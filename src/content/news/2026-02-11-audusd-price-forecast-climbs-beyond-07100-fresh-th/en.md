The AUD/USD pair regained momentum on Wednesday, reversing the previous day's modest pullback and attracting fresh buying interest during the Asian session. The pair pushed decisively above the 0.7100 level, marking its highest point since February 2023 and setting a new three-year peak as traders position ahead of key US data.

The advance comes as investors await the upcoming US Nonfarm Payrolls report, which could influence expectations around Federal Reserve policy and near-term dollar direction. A stronger-than-expected reading may cap gains, while softer figures could extend the rally beyond current highs. For now, sustained trade above 0.7100 keeps the near-term bias tilted to the upside. Market participants remain cautious but supportive of further upside momentum in the current environment overall.
