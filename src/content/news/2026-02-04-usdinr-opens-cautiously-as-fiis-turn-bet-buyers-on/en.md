The Indian Rupee (INR) opened cautiously against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, with the USD/INR pair trading near 90.55, maintaining its losses. The Rupee's early strength comes amid the ongoing optimism surrounding the potential for a US-India trade deal, which has sparked increased interest from Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs).

FIIs are seen turning into net buyers, betting on the positive outlook for the India-US trade relationship. This sentiment is helping support the INR, despite the broader dollar strength in global markets. Traders are closely watching for any developments in trade talks that could provide further momentum to the Rupee in the coming sessions.
