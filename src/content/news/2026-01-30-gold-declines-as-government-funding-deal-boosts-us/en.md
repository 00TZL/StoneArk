Gold prices retreated on Friday as a US government funding deal lifted the US Dollar, triggering a fresh wave of profit-taking across the precious metals market.

The pullback marks a second consecutive day of heavy liquidation following gold’s sharp rally of more than 25% since the start of the month.
