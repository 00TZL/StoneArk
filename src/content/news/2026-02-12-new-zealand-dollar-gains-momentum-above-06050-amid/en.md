The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) is gaining momentum above the 0.6050 mark, with the NZD/USD pair hovering around 0.6055 during early European trading on Thursday. This upward movement comes as the market reacts to a more cautious outlook for the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). 

Despite the recent strength in the NZD, expectations of a gradual and careful tightening cycle by the RBNZ are likely to limit further gains. Investors remain cautious, anticipating that the central bank will take a measured approach to tightening policy, which may weigh on the kiwi's upside potential in the short term.
