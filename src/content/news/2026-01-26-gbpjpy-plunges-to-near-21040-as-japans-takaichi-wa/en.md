The GBP/JPY pair sees a sharp drop of nearly 1% as it slides toward the 210.40 level at the start of the trading week. The yen's strength is primarily attributed to comments from Japan's Economic Security Minister, Takaichi Sanae, who warned that authorities are prepared to intervene in the market if necessary to prevent further yen depreciation. 

Takaichi’s remarks have injected volatility into the currency pair, sparking concerns of increased market intervention from Japan. With the pair now nearing 210.40, traders are closely monitoring the situation, as further escalation could lead to more significant market moves.
