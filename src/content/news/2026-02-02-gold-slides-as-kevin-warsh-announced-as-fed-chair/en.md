Gold prices (XAU/USD) dropped to a two-week low below $4,700 during the Asian trading session on Monday, as market participants took profits following recent gains. The precious metal came under pressure after Kevin Warsh was announced as the new Federal Reserve Chair, raising expectations of tighter monetary policies that could diminish the appeal of non-yielding assets like gold.

Warsh’s appointment stirred speculation about a more hawkish Fed, which may lead to higher interest rates in the near future. This news sparked a shift in investor sentiment, contributing to the slide in gold prices as traders adjusted their positions in anticipation of the Fed's policy stance. The dip marks a significant pullback after a period of price gains.
