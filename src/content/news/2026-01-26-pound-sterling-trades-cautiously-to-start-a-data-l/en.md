The Pound Sterling (GBP) trades cautiously at the start of a data-light week, showing mixed performance against its major peers. On Monday, the British currency edges higher against the US Dollar (USD), hovering near the 1.3665 level, as market participants remain reluctant to take strong directional positions. Thin economic releases leave GBP moves largely driven by broader market sentiment.

With limited high-impact UK data scheduled, investors are focusing on external cues, including global risk appetite and US macro developments. The absence of fresh catalysts keeps volatility subdued, encouraging range-bound trading conditions. As a result, the Pound struggles to establish a clear trend, while short-term price action remains sensitive to shifts in the US Dollar and overall market tone.
