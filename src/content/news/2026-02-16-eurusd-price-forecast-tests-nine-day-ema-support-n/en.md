EUR/USD is seeing a slight decline during Monday's Asian trading session, currently hovering near 1.1870. The pair is testing support from the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around 1.1850, as it struggles to maintain upward momentum.  

The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56, indicating neutral momentum and remaining above the midline. This suggests that while the pair is losing some ground, overall momentum remains positive, and a potential bounce from current levels could be on the horizon. Traders will be looking for further confirmation of direction in the coming sessions.
