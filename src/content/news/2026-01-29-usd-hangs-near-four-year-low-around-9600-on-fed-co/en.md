The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback's performance against a basket of currencies, continues to struggle, hovering near a four-year low around 96.00. This decline comes amid ongoing concerns regarding the Federal Reserve's policy decisions and mounting economic risks, leading to increased selling pressure during the Asian session on Thursday.
