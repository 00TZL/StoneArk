Gold (XAU/USD) continues its sideways movement near the $5,000 level during the Asian session on Friday. The precious metal remains range-bound as traders await crucial U.S. economic data, with market participants showing caution ahead of the upcoming GDP and PCE Price Index releases.

The lack of clear direction in the gold market reflects uncertainty as investors hold off on making significant moves.
