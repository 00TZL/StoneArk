Gold (XAU/USD) has sharply retreated from its recent peak of $5,250, reached during the Asian session, as the precious metal faces downward pressure. The pullback comes after a solid four-day winning streak, suggesting that bullish momentum is starting to fade. The firming U.S. dollar has been a key factor in this reversal, dampening demand for gold as an alternative investment.

The mixed outlook from the Federal Reserve on interest rates is contributing to market uncertainty, with investors weighing potential tightening measures. As a result, gold remains subdued below its monthly high, struggling to regain momentum amid the strength of the USD. Market participants are awaiting further signals from the Fed to gauge the metal's near-term direction.
