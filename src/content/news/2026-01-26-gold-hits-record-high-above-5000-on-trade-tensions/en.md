Gold (XAU/USD) soared to a record high above $5,000 on Monday, marking a significant milestone as escalating trade tensions and economic uncertainties drive investors to seek refuge in safe-haven assets. The precious metal's rally reflects growing concerns over geopolitical instability and the potential impact on global markets, prompting a surge in demand.

As market volatility increases, gold has proved to be a reliable hedge, attracting both retail and institutional investors. Analysts suggest that the ongoing trade disputes and economic risks will likely keep gold prices elevated in the near term, as more traders flock to this traditional safe haven amid uncertainty. The break above the $5,000 mark underscores gold's status as a critical asset in turbulent times.
