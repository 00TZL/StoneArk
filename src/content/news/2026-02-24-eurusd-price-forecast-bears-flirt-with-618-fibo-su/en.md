EUR/USD continues its decline from the 1.1835 level, following a late pullback on Monday, and sees additional selling pressure during the Asian session on Tuesday. The pair is now trading around the 1.1775-1.1770 zone, reflecting a near 0.15% drop for the day. The pullback comes amid a modest rebound in the US Dollar, which is providing the bearish momentum.

The 61.8% Fibonacci support near 1.1775 remains a key level for EUR/USD. If the pair fails to hold above this region, further downside could be expected, with the next support potentially coming in near 1.1750. Traders will closely monitor the USD's performance to determine the next direction for the pair.
