The AUD/JPY pair faces some selling pressure around 106.55 during the early European session on Monday. The Japanese Yen (JPY) gains strength against the Australian Dollar (AUD) as market participants remain wary of potential intervention by Japanese authorities. This uncertainty is weighing on the Aussie, with traders closely monitoring any signs of action from the Bank of Japan.

Despite the pullback, the AUD/JPY still maintains bullish momentum above its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), suggesting a prevailing uptrend. As long as the pair stays above this key technical level, the outlook remains positive for further gains. However, the looming threat of intervention could limit the upside potential in the near term.
