The Indian Rupee (INR) opened lower on Friday, gapping down against the US Dollar (USD) following Thursday's holiday. The Rupee's decline is being driven by rising oil prices, which have put pressure on India's trade balance and economic outlook. As oil costs climb, the demand for US Dollars increases, further weighing on the INR.

In addition to oil price concerns, Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling is adding to the downward pressure on the Rupee. The outflow of capital has been contributing to reduced demand for the INR, leading to further weakness in the currency. With these combined factors, the INR is facing significant challenges in stabilizing against the USD in the near term.
