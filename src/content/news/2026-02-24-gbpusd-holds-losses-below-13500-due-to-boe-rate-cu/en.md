GBP/USD remains under pressure, holding losses below the 1.3500 mark as markets continue to price in potential Bank of England (BoE) rate cuts. The pair, which had seen two days of gains, slips to around 1.3480 during the Asian trading session on Tuesday. This pullback follows a stronger US Dollar (USD), which rebounded after the losses it experienced in the previous two sessions.

The US Dollar’s recovery is contributing to the downward momentum for GBP/USD, as investor sentiment shifts with concerns over BoE policy easing. Traders are closely monitoring any developments regarding interest rates, with a focus on the BoE’s stance in the coming months, which could influence the pound's outlook further.
