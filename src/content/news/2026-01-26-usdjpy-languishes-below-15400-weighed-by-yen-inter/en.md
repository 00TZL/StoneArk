USD/JPY remains under pressure below the 154.00 handle as renewed fears of Japanese Yen intervention cap upside momentum. The pair has extended its pullback after failing to sustain gains seen late last week, with market participants increasingly cautious amid speculation that authorities may step in to curb excessive Yen weakness. This shift in sentiment has kept the US Dollar on the defensive against the Japanese currency.

The Yen has reversed earlier losses to emerge as the strongest-performing G8 currency on Monday. Rising talk of a potential joint US-Japan intervention has driven a sharp repricing, pushing USD/JPY nearly 3.5% lower from Friday’s peak. The pair slid to fresh 11-week lows in the mid-153.00s, highlighting how sensitive markets remain to policy signals and intervention risks.
