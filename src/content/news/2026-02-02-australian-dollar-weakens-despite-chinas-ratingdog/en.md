The Australian Dollar (AUD) extended its losses on Monday, continuing a downward trend after a 1% drop in the previous session. The AUD/USD pair remains under pressure despite a slight uptick in China's RatingDog Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which rose to 50.3 in January from 50.1 in December.

Investors had hoped the increase in China's PMI would support the Australian currency, given Australia's trade ties with China. However, the AUD continues to face headwinds as market sentiment remains cautious, with lingering concerns over global growth and domestic economic challenges. The USD, bolstered by stronger economic data, maintains its strength, keeping the AUD subdued in early trading.
