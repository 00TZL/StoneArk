The NZD/USD pair extends its rally for the seventh straight day, reaching a fresh high beyond the mid-0.5900s on Monday. This marks the highest level for the pair since September 2025, driven by a broad-based decline in the US Dollar (USD). 

The weaker USD, largely influenced by shifting market sentiment and economic data, continues to support the New Zealand Dollar's (NZD) upward momentum. With the NZD/USD trading at its highest point in nearly two years, traders are watching closely for any signs of reversal, although the current trend remains strong as the pair benefits from favorable conditions for the NZD.
