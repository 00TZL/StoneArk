USD/CHF has made a notable rebound after opening lower this morning, trading around 0.7770 during the Asian session on Monday. The pair saw a gap down at the start of the week but has quickly regained some ground, buoyed by fresh strength in the US Dollar.

The recent recovery in the USD/CHF comes amid renewed concerns over US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, which have supported the greenback. As markets digest the potential impact of these developments, the currency pair is now heading toward the 0.7800 mark, with traders closely watching any further escalations in US trade policy.
