The Japanese Yen maintains its intraday gains as fears over a potential trade war continue to bolster safe-haven assets. The USD/JPY pair is under significant pressure during the Asian session on Monday, falling sharply towards the 154.00 round figure. However, the pair has managed to recover slightly, now trading around 154.35.

Despite this small rebound, the pair remains down more than 0.45% for the day. The Japanese Yen appears resilient, with the potential for further downside in the USD/JPY as concerns about escalating global trade tensions continue to support demand for the Yen. This highlights the continued preference for safer assets amidst rising geopolitical uncertainty.
