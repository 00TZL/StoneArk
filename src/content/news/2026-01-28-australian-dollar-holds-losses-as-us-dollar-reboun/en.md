The Australian Dollar (AUD) is experiencing a downward trend against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, following a strong performance in the previous session where it gained over 1%. Market sentiment has shifted, leading to a rebound in the USD as traders adjust their positions ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve policy announcement.

Investors are closely monitoring signals from the Fed, which could impact currency markets significantly. As uncertainty looms, the AUD's recent gains are being eroded, reflecting the broader dynamics at play as the USD strengthens. The focus remains on how the Fed's decisions may influence future currency movements and trader strategies in the days ahead.
