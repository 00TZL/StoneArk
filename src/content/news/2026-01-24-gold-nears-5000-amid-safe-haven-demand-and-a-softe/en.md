Gold (XAU/USD) surged to nearly $5,000 on Friday, driven by strong safe-haven demand amid a softer US Dollar. The precious metal rose from an intraday low of $4,899 to trade around $4,980, marking another record high. This recent rally comes as investors seek refuge in gold, capitalizing on economic uncertainty and a weakening USD.

With XAU/USD on track for a third consecutive weekly gain, market sentiment remains cautious. The softer USD continues to support gold prices, making it an attractive alternative for investors. As gold edges closer to the $5,000 mark, analysts are closely watching for further developments in the currency markets, particularly the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs, as these shifts may influence gold’s next move.
