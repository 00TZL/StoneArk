The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues its impressive rally for a second consecutive day, holding firm against the US Dollar (USD) in the Asian session on Monday. Trading close to its highest level since November 14, the Yen remains supported by a broadly weaker USD, as risk sentiment and market expectations of potential interventions by Japan's authorities keep investors cautious.

At the time of writing, USD/JPY hovers just below the 154.00 mark, with the pair showing little sign of reversing course. The prospect of further monetary policy action or verbal interventions from Japan's central bank and government remains a key risk factor, potentially limiting the Yen's gains and introducing volatility in the near term.
