EUR/USD holds steady near 1.1750 on Friday as mixed US economic data fails to provide significant momentum for the US Dollar. Despite a series of economic reports, including weaker-than-expected consumer sentiment, the Greenback struggles to gain ground. This lack of clarity in the US data left investors with little direction, keeping the Euro largely unchanged against the Dollar.

The pair is currently on track for its first weekly gain in three weeks, reflecting continued weakness in the Greenback. With the US data failing to offer fresh support, traders remain cautious, but the Euro is benefitting from the broader softness in USD. As a result, EUR/USD maintains its position near 1.1750 as the week comes to a close.
