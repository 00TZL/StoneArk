The US Dollar Index is trading around 97.00 as investors await the release of crucial Consumer Price Index (CPI) data later this week. Market participants are closely monitoring the report, as it could influence expectations for future Federal Reserve rate hikes and the broader economic outlook. The dollar’s performance remains steady, but its direction will largely depend on the inflation figures, which are expected to shed light on the health of the US economy.

In the commodities market, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised its global oil demand forecast, now predicting a surplus of 3.7 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2026. This adjustment follows a weaker-than-expected demand outlook, signaling potential challenges for oil prices in the coming years. The IEA’s forecast is contributing to caution in the oil market as traders weigh future supply and demand dynamics.
