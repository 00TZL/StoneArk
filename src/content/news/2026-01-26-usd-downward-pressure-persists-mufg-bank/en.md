The US Dollar Index (DXY) continues to face downward pressure, having slipped below the 98.00 mark, according to Lloyd Chan, Senior Currency Analyst at MUFG Bank. This decline reflects ongoing concerns about the strength of the US economy and the potential for a shift in monetary policy as market participants weigh the implications of recent economic data.

Chan emphasizes that this downward trend may persist as investors reassess their outlook for the dollar amid fluctuating market conditions. The weakening of the DXY could impact various currency pairs and create opportunities for traders, highlighting the need for close monitoring of upcoming economic indicators that may influence the dollar's trajectory.
