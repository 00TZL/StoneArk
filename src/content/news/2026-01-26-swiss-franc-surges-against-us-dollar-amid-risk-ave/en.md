The Swiss Franc strengthened sharply against the US Dollar on Monday as heightened risk aversion and lingering concerns over Federal Reserve policy fueled demand for safe-haven assets. Investors remained cautious amid uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook, prompting a rotation away from the Greenback and into traditionally defensive currencies such as the Franc.

As a result, USD/CHF fell to around 0.7760 at the time of writing, down 0.70% on the day. The pair touched its lowest level since September 2011, underscoring the intensity of the current bearish pressure on the US Dollar. Persistent doubts about the Fed’s policy trajectory and broader market volatility continue to weigh on USD/CHF, keeping the Swiss Franc firmly supported in the near term.
