The Indian Rupee (INR) opened flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, with the USD/INR pair continuing to trade within a narrow range near the 91.00 level. Investors are closely monitoring developments in the US trade policy, which has contributed to the subdued movement in the pair.

Amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future direction of US trade policies, market participants remain cautious. This has led to a sideways movement in the USD/INR, with the currency pair showing little volatility in the absence of fresh triggers. Traders are waiting for clearer signals before taking more decisive positions.
