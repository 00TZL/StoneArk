The British Pound (GBP) weakened against the Japanese Yen (JPY) on Monday, with the pair slipping to 209.62 before stabilizing around 210.50. This marks a near 0.95% drop for the day, as the Yen showed strength across the market.

The catalyst for the move appears to be growing speculation of potential intervention in the currency markets, which is driving increased demand for the Yen. Traders are closely monitoring any signs of action from Japanese authorities to curb the Yen's recent volatility, adding further pressure on GBP/JPY. As the situation develops, market sentiment remains sensitive to further intervention talk.
