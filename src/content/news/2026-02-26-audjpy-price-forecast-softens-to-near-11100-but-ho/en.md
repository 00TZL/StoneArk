The AUD/JPY currency pair is experiencing a slight decline, trading around 111.15 during the early European session on Thursday. The Japanese Yen (JPY) has strengthened against the Australian Dollar (AUD) following hawkish comments from Bank of Japan (BoJ) officials, boosting expectations of tighter monetary policy.

Despite the softening, the AUD/JPY remains above the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), maintaining its bullish momentum. The pair’s ability to hold above this key technical level suggests that upward pressure may continue, with a potential return to higher levels if market sentiment shifts in favor of the Australian Dollar. Traders will be closely watching further comments from BoJ officials for additional direction.
