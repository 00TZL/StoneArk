The Japanese Yen is currently leading the G10 currencies, fueled by growing speculation of possible intervention by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). As the yen strengthens, traders are increasingly eyeing any signals that the BoJ might step in to stabilize the currency.

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has added to the speculation, with her recent remarks suggesting that the Japanese government is ready to take action against speculative movements in the foreign exchange market.
