The Japanese Yen (JPY) remains under pressure through the Asian trading session on Friday, as softer-than-expected consumer inflation in Tokyo dampens expectations for an immediate interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Tokyo's Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed weaker growth, suggesting that inflationary pressures in the capital are not as strong as anticipated.

This data has sparked doubts about the BoJ's readiness to tighten its accommodative policy anytime soon, which had been speculated in recent weeks. Alongside this, concerns surrounding Japan's fiscal health and political uncertainty are also weighing on the Yen, limiting any significant recovery. Traders will now look ahead to further economic data for clues on the BoJ's next moves.
