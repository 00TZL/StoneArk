Gold (XAU/USD) continues its upward trajectory on Monday, hovering near the $5,100 mark as geopolitical tensions, fresh tariffs from US President Trump, and a weakening US Dollar contribute to its gains. The combination of risk-off sentiment in the market and concerns over potential Yen intervention has further supported the precious metal’s rise.
