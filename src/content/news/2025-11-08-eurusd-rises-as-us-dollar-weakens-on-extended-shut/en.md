The EUR/USD pair rebounded from earlier losses, posting a 0.16% gain in the late North American session on Friday. This uptick can be attributed to the weakening US Dollar, which has been impacted by the ongoing government shutdown and prevailing market uncertainty. With a light economic calendar on both sides of the Atlantic, traders are closely monitoring the forex market for potential trading opportunities. As investors navigate this landscape, the Euro's relative strength against the Dollar has allowed EUR/USD to edge higher. Market participants continue to weigh the implications of the shutdown and uncertain economic outlook, influencing trading decisions in the forex market.
