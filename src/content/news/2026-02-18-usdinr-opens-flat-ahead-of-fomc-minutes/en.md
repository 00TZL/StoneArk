The Indian Rupee (INR) opened nearly flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the USD/INR pair trading around 90.80. Market sentiment is subdued as traders remain cautious ahead of the much-anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes, due for release at 19:00 GMT.

Investors are closely monitoring the FOMC Minutes, as any hints about future monetary policy decisions could significantly impact the currency pair. As a result, the USD/INR is expected to fluctuate within its current range until more clarity emerges from the minutes, with market participants staying on edge for any signs of changes in the US central bank's stance.
