West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have risen slightly, trading at approximately $62.65 during the Asian trading session on Wednesday. The uptick comes as a winter storm in the United States raises concerns over potential supply disruptions and production losses in the oil sector.

Market analysts are closely monitoring the situation, as adverse weather conditions could impact drilling operations and transportation. The current WTI price reflects these worries, as traders factor in the possibility of reduced output due to the storm's effects. As the situation develops, investors will be watching for updates that could further influence crude oil prices in the coming days.
