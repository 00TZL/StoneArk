The USD/INR saw a dip today as the Indian Rupee (INR) gained strength following the announcement of an interim trade deal between the United States and India. The agreement, revealed on Friday, aims to reduce tariffs, reshape energy partnerships, and enhance broader economic cooperation between the two nations.
