The AUD/USD pair has managed to hold onto early gains, trading 0.35% higher at around 0.6935 during the European session on Monday. The Australian dollar is showing resilience as it benefits from a broad weakness in the US Dollar (USD) to start the week.

The US Dollar is facing significant pressure across the board, providing support for the Aussie. This weakness in the greenback comes amid ongoing concerns about US economic data and potential interest rate cuts. As a result, the AUD/USD remains in a positive momentum, with traders keeping a close eye on further developments in global markets.
