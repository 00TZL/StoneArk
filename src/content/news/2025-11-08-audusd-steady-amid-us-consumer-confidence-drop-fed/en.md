The AUD/USD currency pair is holding steady around 0.6480 as US consumer confidence slipped sharply, marking the latest blow to US sentiment. The drop fuels speculation that the Federal Reserve may pause rate hikes, adding uncertainty to USD pricing. Traders see the pair trading sideways, with the 0.6500 resistance and 0.6450 support levels in focus.  

With the US data pointing to weaker household spending, risk‑off sentiment could pressure the dollar against major currencies, including the EUR. The AUD, viewed as a commodity‑linked currency, benefits from stable risk appetite, keeping the exchange rate near its recent range. Technical charts suggest a breakout above 0.6500 could trigger a rally, while a slip below 0.6450 may open a short‑term downtrend.  

Traders will watch upcoming US inflation reports and Fed minutes for clues on policy direction, which could swing the USD and, by extension, the AUD/USD pair. Until clearer guidance emerges, the market is likely to remain range‑bound, with the 0.6480 level acting as a pivot. Any surprise in US data could quickly shift sentiment across the forex landscape.
