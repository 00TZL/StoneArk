The Australian Dollar (AUD) has rebounded from a bearish gap that opened last week, pushing the AUD/USD pair down to around 0.7030, marking the lower boundary of a three-week-old range. The retreat of the US Dollar (USD) has provided support for the Aussie, enabling it to recover lost ground.

During the Asian session, the AUD/USD pair regained momentum and climbed back above the 0.7100 level. This move marks a notable reversal as the pair shifts away from recent lows, driven by a retreat in the USD following its recent strength. Traders will now watch for further developments as the pair navigates the mid-range levels.
