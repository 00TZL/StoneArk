Gold prices surged during the North American session on Friday, rising 0.64% as the ongoing US government shutdown and weak economic data fueled safe‑haven demand. This risk‑off sentiment also weighed on US equity markets, which are on track to post weekly losses. At the time of writing, gold (XAU/USD) was trading at $4,002, having rebounded from its daily low of $3,974. The precious metal’s rally is driven by investors seeking refuge in traditional safe‑havens amid forex market volatility. As trading activity continues, gold’s appeal as a hedge against uncertainty remains strong, supporting its price. With no clear end to the US shutdown in sight, gold may continue to benefit from haven demand, making it a key asset to watch in forex trading circles.
