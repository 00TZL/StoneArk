Market participants are closely watching the Fed’s policy announcement, with expectations surrounding potential changes in interest rates and guidance on future economic conditions. This retreat in the Dollar reflects uncertainty ahead of the Fed's meeting, as investors adjust their positions in anticipation of possible shifts in monetary policy.
