The Indian Rupee (INR) looks set for a positive start on Tuesday as the US Dollar weakens across the board, offering some relief to emerging market currencies. Market sentiment has improved slightly after recent volatility, though traders remain cautious amid ongoing concerns over capital flows and global monetary policy signals.

On Friday, the USD/INR pair closed with modest gains of 0.1% at 91.87. During the session, the pair touched a fresh all-time high of 92.21, reflecting sustained pressure on the Rupee. The INR’s weakness was largely driven by continued foreign fund outflows from Indian equities, which kept demand for the US Dollar elevated despite the late pullback.
