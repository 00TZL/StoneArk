Gold (XAU/USD) continues to face downward pressure, marking a second consecutive day of losses as it dips to the $4,922 mark during Tuesday's Asian session. The weakening of the precious metal comes amid a strengthening U.S. dollar and a prevailing risk-on sentiment in global markets, which have dampened demand for safe-haven assets.

Thin liquidity, driven by the Lunar New Year holidays in China, has contributed to the lack of significant market movement. Investors are also positioning themselves ahead of the upcoming release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes, which could provide further clues on future monetary policy and impact market sentiment in the near term.
