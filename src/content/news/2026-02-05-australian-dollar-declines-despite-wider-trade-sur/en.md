The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued to lose ground against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, despite positive news from Australia’s Trade Balance data. The December 2025 report revealed that the country’s trade surplus expanded to AUD 3,373 million, surpassing November’s downwardly revised surplus of AUD 2,597 million. This was also slightly above market expectations.

While the broader surplus increase suggests a strengthening trade position, the AUD remained under pressure. The ongoing weakness in the Australian currency points to broader concerns in the market, with traders focusing on global economic factors rather than just domestic trade data.
