Sterling extended its rally against the US Dollar on Friday, with the GBP/USD currency pair surging to the 1.3600 handle as intensified USD selling swept through forex trading. The exchange rate is up nearly 0.73% on the day, pushing cable to its strongest level since September 18, 2025, and marking a clear four-month high amid shifting market sentiment.

Broad-based weakness in the Greenback has been the primary driver, as traders continue to unwind USD positions across major pairs. The Dollar has also struggled against peers such as the EUR, reinforcing the view that capital flows are rotating away from the US currency. This dynamic has allowed the British Pound to outperform, supported by firm demand and favorable trading conditions.

From a market perspective, the move above 1.3600 is technically significant and could encourage further upside if USD pressure persists. Sustained trading at these levels may shift near-term bias in GBP/USD, with investors reassessing exchange rate expectations as the Dollar’s softness reshapes the broader forex landscape.
