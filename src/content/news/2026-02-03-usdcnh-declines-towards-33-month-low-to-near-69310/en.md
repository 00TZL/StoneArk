The USD/CNH pair has fallen to 6.9350 during Tuesday's late Asian session, edging closer to its 33-month low of 6.9310. The Chinese Yuan (CNH) is gaining strength against the US Dollar (USD) as seasonal demand continues to support the Yuan's performance.

The ongoing trend reflects heightened demand for the Yuan in the lead-up to the Lunar New Year, which typically boosts trade flows and capital movements in China. As a result, the USD/CNH pair is under pressure, with the Yuan continuing to outperform its US counterpart, further driving the pair lower towards the 6.9310 mark.
