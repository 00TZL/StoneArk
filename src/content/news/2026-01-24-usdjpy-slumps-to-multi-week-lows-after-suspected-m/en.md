USD/JPY fell sharply on Friday, dropping over 300 pips to hit a multi-week low after speculation emerged of a rate check by the Japan Ministry of Finance (MoF). The currency pair slumped to 156.18, marking a near 1.40% drop on the day. This decline was driven by growing concerns over excessive Yen weakness, fueling fears of potential intervention in the market.

At the time of writing, USD/JPY remains under pressure, trading at levels not seen since late December. The rapid decline comes amid increasing speculation that Japan may act to curb the Yen's depreciation. This heightened volatility reflects ongoing market uncertainty, with traders wary of government intervention as the exchange rate continues to climb, straining the Yen's value.
