EUR/GBP has remained steady above the 0.8750 mark, trading around 0.8770 during the Asian session on Monday, after experiencing two consecutive days of gains. The pair is currently consolidating, with investors awaiting key economic data.

Focus now shifts to the release of German Retail Sales figures, set to provide insight into the health of Europe's largest economy. A stronger-than-expected reading could boost the euro, while a miss may weigh on EUR/GBP, potentially influencing market sentiment as traders adjust their positions ahead of the data release.
