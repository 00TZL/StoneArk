The AUD/JPY pair drops to around 109.05 during the early European session on Monday. Renewed fears of a trade war, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, and broader market uncertainty are driving demand for safe-haven currencies like the Japanese Yen (JPY), putting pressure on the Australian Dollar (AUD).

Despite the decline, the pair is holding above the 100-day EMA, maintaining a bullish bias. As long as the price stays above this key support level, the outlook remains positive for AUD/JPY, suggesting that a rebound could be possible if market sentiment shifts. Traders will be watching for further developments in global risks for additional direction.
