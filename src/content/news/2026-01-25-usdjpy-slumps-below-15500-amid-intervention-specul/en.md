The USD/JPY pair has dropped significantly, trading around 154.75 in the early Asian session on Monday, marking its lowest point since December 17. This decline reflects a strengthening of the Japanese Yen as traders react to growing speculation regarding potential intervention by Japanese authorities to curb the Yen's recent weakness against the US Dollar.

Market sentiment is increasingly focused on the possibility of intervention, leading to a cautious approach among investors. The USD's recent performance has raised concerns about the Yen's depreciation, prompting speculation that the Bank of Japan may step in to stabilize the currency. As a result, traders are closely monitoring the situation for any signs of official action that could impact the USD/JPY exchange rate further.
