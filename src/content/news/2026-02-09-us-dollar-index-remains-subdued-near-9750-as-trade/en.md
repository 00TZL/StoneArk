The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the USD against six major currencies, continues its downward momentum, trading near 97.60 during the Asian session on Monday. This marks a second consecutive session of losses, as traders remain cautious ahead of upcoming economic data releases.

Market participants are focusing on key indicators expected later this week, which could provide fresh insights into the strength of the US economy. The DXY’s subdued performance reflects the market's wait-and-see approach, with volatility likely to increase once the data is released, influencing the next moves for the greenback.
