The AUD/JPY pair faces a slight decline to 109.15 during the early European session on Wednesday. This movement comes as foreign inflows into Japanese equities surge following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s significant election victory. The positive sentiment towards Japanese markets boosts demand for the Japanese Yen (JPY), putting pressure on the Australian Dollar (AUD).

Despite this pullback, the outlook for AUD/JPY remains constructive as long as the pair stays above the 109.00 level. Any further declines could still find support at this key technical level, which is crucial for maintaining the pair's bullish momentum in the near term. Traders will be keeping an eye on additional economic developments from both Australia and Japan for further direction.
