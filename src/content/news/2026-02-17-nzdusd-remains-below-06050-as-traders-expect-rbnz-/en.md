NZD/USD continues to trade below the 0.6050 mark as traders anticipate the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will hold interest rates steady. At the time of writing, the pair is hovering around the 0.6030 level, showing limited movement during the Asian trading session.

The market sentiment is largely shaped by expectations that the RBNZ will maintain its current monetary policy stance, with no immediate changes to interest rates. As a result, the New Zealand dollar remains under pressure, struggling to gain significant momentum against the US dollar. Traders will likely keep an eye on any developments or statements from the RBNZ that could shift market sentiment in the near term.
