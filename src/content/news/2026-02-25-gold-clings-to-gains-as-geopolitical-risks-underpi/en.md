Gold (XAU/USD) maintains modest gains through the Asian session on Wednesday, trading just below the $5,200 level. The precious metal continues to hover near its monthly peak, reached the previous day, as geopolitical risks keep safe-haven demand intact. 

Despite a weaker U.S. dollar, gold's upward momentum is supported by growing uncertainties in global markets, further boosting its appeal as a safe-haven asset. As concerns over geopolitical tensions persist, gold's steady performance reflects investor caution, with the metal maintaining its position as a key hedge against market volatility.
