EUR/USD is holding onto its gains, trading near the 1.1860 level on Monday, just below the four-month highs of 1.1875 reached earlier in the day. The pair remains buoyed by continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, which is struggling to gain momentum.

The dollar is under pressure ahead of key U.S. economic data, with durable goods orders set to be released later today. Market participants are cautious, awaiting the data for further direction, as any signs of economic slowdown could weigh on the greenback, potentially allowing EUR/USD to maintain its recent upward momentum.
