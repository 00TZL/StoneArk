Silver has seen an impressive rise of over 200% year-on-year, according to HSBC Asset Management. This surge has caught the attention of investors, as the price of the precious metal continues to climb, leading to a significant shift in the gold/silver ratio. The rapid growth has sparked debates among market analysts on whether now is the right time to reconsider Silver's position in portfolios.

As the dynamics of the market evolve, HSBC suggests that the surge in Silver's price could signal a turning point. With the gold/silver ratio changing drastically, investors may need to evaluate their strategies and consider if it’s time to sell or adjust their holdings in Silver amidst the market shift.
