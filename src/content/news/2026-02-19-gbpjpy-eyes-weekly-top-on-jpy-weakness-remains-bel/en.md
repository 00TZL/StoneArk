GBP/JPY saw continued buying interest for a second day in a row, rising to the upper end of its weekly range during Thursday's Asian session. The pair benefited from broad weakness in the Japanese yen, which has been under pressure amid ongoing concerns about the Bank of Japan's accommodative stance. 

Despite the positive momentum, GBP/JPY remains below the mid-209.00s, as the divergence between the Bank of England's tightening cycle and Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy continues to weigh on the pair.
