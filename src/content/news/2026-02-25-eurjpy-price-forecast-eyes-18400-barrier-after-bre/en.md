EUR/JPY continues its upward momentum, marking a second consecutive day of gains. As of Wednesday's Asian session, the pair is trading around 183.70, maintaining a bullish tone. The recent move has seen EUR/JPY break above key moving averages, signaling increased buying interest and pushing the pair closer to the 184.00 resistance level.

With the pair holding above these moving averages, the outlook remains positive, and the focus is now on a potential test of the 184.00 barrier. A sustained move above this level could open the door for further gains, with traders eyeing the next major resistance zones. However, any retracement below 183.00 could shift momentum to the downside.
