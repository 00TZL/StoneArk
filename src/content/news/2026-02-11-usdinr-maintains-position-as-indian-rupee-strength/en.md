The USD/INR pair showed minimal movement on Wednesday, following a slight decline in the previous session. The Indian Rupee (INR) is being bolstered by continued foreign equity inflows, alongside a broad weakening of the US Dollar (USD). This favorable backdrop is helping the Rupee maintain its strength against the Greenback.

However, INR’s upward momentum may face limitations due to persistent demand for the US Dollar from local corporate sectors. The steady need for USD to meet business requirements in India is likely to cap the Rupee’s gains, keeping the pair within a narrow range. Market participants will continue to monitor global developments and local corporate activity for any significant shifts in this dynamic.
