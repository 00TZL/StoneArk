The Japanese Yen (JPY) remains under pressure, trading near a two-week low against the stronger US Dollar (USD) during Thursday’s Asian session. Despite the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish stance, concerns surrounding Japan's fiscal challenges and political uncertainty continue to weigh heavily on the currency, leaving it vulnerable to further losses.

In recent days, the Yen has struggled to attract buyers, with its downtrend from the past week showing little sign of reversal.
