The USD/INR pair weakened on Tuesday, reversing two days of gains. The Indian Rupee (INR) saw a boost due to strong foreign inflows, with market sentiment supported by ongoing optimism over the US-India trade deal. Despite this, the Rupee faced some resistance in the previous session as the US Dollar (USD) maintained its strength, driven by continued hedging activity and routine local flows, according to bankers.

Bankers noted that the INR’s rally was somewhat restrained as market participants remained cautious, and hedging activity continued to pressure the currency pair. The USD/INR’s near-term outlook will likely depend on developments around the trade agreement and overall global market dynamics.
