The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued its downward trend on Friday, marking a third consecutive day of losses against the US Dollar (USD). Weighed down by widespread risk aversion, the currency struggled to find support as global equities and other risk-sensitive assets saw significant selling pressure.  

The broader market sentiment remained cautious, with investors retreating to safer assets amid mounting concerns over global economic conditions.
